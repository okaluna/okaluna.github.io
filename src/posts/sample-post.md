<div class="post-meta">
📅 {{ date }} �
</div>

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0; padding: 2rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, var(--pastel-purple), var(--pastel-blue)); border-radius: 25px;">
    <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">✨ My first original composition! ✨</h2>
    <div style="font-size: 4rem; margin: 1rem 0;">🎹🎵</div>
    <p>I've been practicing piano for 6 months now, and I finally wrote my own little piece! It's called "Moonlight Dreams" �</p>
</div>

## � How I Created It

I spent last weekend working on this! Here's my creative process:

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr)); gap: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0;">
    <div style="padding: 1.5rem; background: var(--pastel-yellow); border-radius: 20px; text-align: center;">
        <h3>1️⃣ Found the Melody</h3>
        <div style="font-size: 3rem;">🎵</div>
        <p>I started by humming a simple melody that came to me while looking at the stars</p>
    </div>
    <div style="padding: 1.5rem; background: var(--pastel-blue); border-radius: 20px; text-align: center;">
        <h3>2️⃣ Added Chords</h3>
        <div style="font-size: 3rem;">🎹</div>
        <p>Then I figured out simple chords that fit with my melody</p>
    </div>
    <div style="padding: 1.5rem; background: var(--pastel-green); border-radius: 20px; text-align: center;">
        <h3>3️⃣ Wrote It Down</h3>
        <div style="font-size: 3rem;">📝</div>
        <p>Finally, I wrote the notes on staff paper so I won't forget!</p>
    </div>
</div>

## 💭 What I Learned

Composing my first piece taught me so much:

- � **Melody comes first**: Start with a simple tune you can hum
- � **Keep it simple**: Even basic chords can sound beautiful
- 📝 **Write it down**: I almost forgot the melody before I wrote it!
- � **Inspiration is everywhere**: Looking at the night sky helped me find my melody

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0; padding: 2rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, var(--pastel-purple), var(--pastel-coral)); border-radius: 25px;">
    <h3>� Want to Try Composing?</h3>
    <p>My teacher says anyone can write music! Just start with a simple melody you like.</p>
    <div style="margin: 1rem 0;">
        <span style="font-size: 2rem;">🎵 � ✨ � �</span>
    </div>
</div>

## 🎧 Next Steps

I'm super excited about composing more! My piano teacher said we can work on:

- Adding a simple bass line
- Maybe recording it on my phone
- Learning about different time signatures

I might even try writing lyrics for it someday!
